          <div class="post-content">
            <p>2 weeks down in my Database Administration Fundamentals class. 2 more to go.</p>
            <p>Halfway through the class, I feel like I have learned a lot. While we have been getting some experience using
            the language of SQL, the class is more geared towards databases as whole. Creating them, adding information to tables, and extracting the information
            that we need.</p>
            <p>If becoming a database administrator or developer was my goal, this class would be of more value. But since I am more interested in the data
            stored within, the lessons on DML (data manipulation language) are more interesting to me. This definitely has me looking forward to my next class,
            which is SQL Base Programming.</p>
            <p>Going back to the emotions I was experiencing prior to the class starting, Anxiousness is no longer there. Excitement is still present,
            because of what we have been learning so far and what I know is on the horizon in the next class.</p>
            <p>Uncertainty is still there, because while I am learning a lot, I want to be able to put the new skills to use. Trying to find ways
            to do this at work has been difficult. Everything we do in class is through SQL Server and the studio interface, which I do not have
            access to at work. Having downloaded both SQL Server and SSMS on my home computer, looks like project time at home for the forseeable future.</p>
            <p>Changing topics real quick, all of this learning has inspired me to look into other types of coding. I have been working through another site called
            <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> to continue enhancing my web development skills. I am even looking at doing one of
            their Pro Intensives: a 10 week, bootcamp style course in website building.</p>
            <p>So many things to learn and do, and just not enough time in the days to accomplish them all. 2 weeks left, with a "staycation"
            scheduled for the final week of the class. I'll have more than 1 thing to look forward to in that final week.</p>

            <p>Just a few days separate me from returning to a classroom for the first time since April of 2008. <strong>Excitement. Anxiousness. Uncertainty.</strong> Just some of the thoughts and feelings I’m having right now.</p>
            <p><strong>Excitement</strong> because of the what and why. After what felt like, quite literally, Googling every data analytics online graduate program I could think of, I realized that there were some technical skills that I lacked before I could really move forward.</p>
            <p>After talking to a coworker who was taking a class through a local community college, I thought I would look to see what they had to offer, and there it was. A Data Analytics w/ SQL certificate. 3 classes that looked to cover exactly what I think I need to get started: Database Administration Fundamentals. SQL Base Programming. SQL Advanced Programming.</p>
            <p><strong>Anxiousness</strong> and <strong>Uncertainty</strong> because after registering for the first 2 class for the upcoming fall semester, I stumbled upon a website that provided an online curriculum for Data Analytics. Part of this curriculum included courses on SQL. Did I screw myself over by registering and paying for something that I could’ve done online, at my own pace for a much lower cost?</p>
            <p>Since signing up for this website (more to come on that) to give some of their free courses a trial, I am more at ease with my decision to take the SQL classes in-person. The benefit of having an in-person instructor that I can ask questions, along with other people to collaborate with, will help me with picking up the material.</p>
            <p>Tuesday will be an interesting day. The classes are at the college’s center in the Ballantyne area of Charlotte, while I work in Mooresville. 40 miles apart. Looking to leave work at 4:00 to make sure that I can arrive with time to spare for a class that is from 6:00 to 9:00, 2 nights a week.</p>
            <p><strong> Excitement. Anxiousness. Uncertainty.</strong> We’ll see which of these thoughts and feelings are still around after Thursday night.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
           <p><strong>Wow!</strong> I've actually published this blog. When I started working on this little project only a few days ago, I wasn't sure of what to expect.</p>
           <p>In just 5 shorts days (really, 3?), I was able to take this thing from a blank screen in the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> text editor
             I downloaded, upload the files to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, and have a functioning blog on the web.</p>
           <p>Hopefully, this is just a glimpse of what is to come. In about a week and half, I will begin taking classes through a local community college for their Data Analytics certificate.
             The focus of these classes will be on database fundamentals and SQL.
           <p>I'm really looking forward to jumping back into the realm of learning something new (much like creating this little project).</p>
           <p>More to come on that, and some other things, later. Right now, its past midnight when I am making this post, so I think I will go to bed! Until next time...</p>
