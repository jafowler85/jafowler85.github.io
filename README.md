This is my personal blogsite that I use to experiment while I am learning the ins and outs of web design/development. Updated posts amd major changes will be documented here.

10/19/2017: Updated box-sizing property to border-box. Added background image to body.

10/07/2017: updated CSS file. Added buttons to header navigation list items. Expanded width of header/footer to allow for text to move farther towards edges for a better look. Update header/footer colors, hover colors.
