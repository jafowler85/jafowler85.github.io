           <p><strong>Wow!</strong> I've actually published this blog. When I started working on this little project only a few days ago, I wasn't sure of what to expect.</p>
           <p>In just 5 shorts days (really, 3?), I was able to take this thing from a blank screen in the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> text editor
             I downloaded, upload the files to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, and have a functioning blog on the web.</p>
           <p>Hopefully, this is just a glimpse of what is to come. In about a week and half, I will begin taking classes through a local community college for their Data Analytics certificate.
             The focus of these classes will be on database fundamentals and SQL.
           <p>I'm really looking forward to jumping back into the realm of learning something new (much like creating this little project).</p>
           <p>More to come on that, and some other things, later. Right now, its past midnight when I am making this post, so I think I will go to bed! Until next time...</p>

           <p>Uggghhh...ever since he started using that <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> app to build this blog, he barely notices I'm here!</p>
           <p>Jokes on him though. Little does <em>he</em> know that i've been using his iPad to learn coding <strong>myself</strong>!</p>
           <p><em>Spoilers: my cat did not make this post. I wanted to have some fun with one of the challenges from the app.</em></p>

           <p>I plan to use this blog/website to document my <em>journey</em> on learning how to <strong>code</strong>, specifically for data analytics.</p>
           <p>Beginning with the help of the <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> app, this blog will be built from scratch!</p>
